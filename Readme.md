Mission
-------

I am a programmer trying as best I can to use my skills for the good of the world. As an intermediate goal I try learn as much as humanly possible about everything. I am interested in projects that work towards social justice, elevate the level of discourse, save humanity from itself, or make others more productive in their work toward these aims.

Experience
----------

### Skillshare (2012 - 2013)
At Skillshare I was a back-end turned full-stack engineer who helped develop the online education platform from pre-launch through its development into a relatively stable product. Skillshare's stack is PHP (Yii framework), JS (Backbone, require, JQuery), Sass, nginx, memcache, Redis, and AWS. These are the specific projects that I worked on, in rough chronological order: 

+ Refactored all the date handling to be time zone-aware.
+ Developed the strategy and built the back end for the Groups feature, which lets classmates collaborate in small groups.
+ Re-built the back end for nested comments to make comment threads load faster with easily modifiable behavior (no longer on the site).
+ Designed and built the API for the class creator (skillshare.com/classes/online/new).
+ Optimized several key pages by implementing caching, rewriting and eliminating queries, and restructuring code. These optimizations resulted in a dramatic decrease in app server average response time (~%40 improvement).
+ Refactored comment threads to be rendered client-side, speeding up page loads.
+ Migrated the entire back end infrastructure from Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk to their new Opsworks product, allowing much finer-grained control over the server fleet.
+ Developed the product strategy for a reputation feature, which hasn't yet been built.
+ Built the class reviews feature on the class details page.
+ Refactored the front end of the class creator to be more maintainable, and support arbitrary class states (draft, pending review, etc.).
+ Built the file attachment feature on the class creator.
+ Crushed lots and lots of bugs.

### Rapleaf (Summer 2011)
I was an engineering intern at Rapleaf (now LiveRamp). I worked on the web team developing the InstantData product and lots of internal tools. Their stack was Ruby, Rails, JQuery, Sass.

Education
---------

I studied Computer Science at Oberlin College, with minors in Math and Philosophy.

Research
--------

### Algorithmic Game Theory
I spent the summer of 2010 doing research with professors Tom Wexler, Alexa Sharp, and Kevin Woods in algorithmic game theory. My specific work was on "the virus innoculation game." The results were even less interesting than you might expect.

### Heliospheric Physics
I spent a summer in high school at science camp working on a project with professor Charles W. Smith. The project was related to his work on interplanetary traveling bow shocks. He asked me to continue working with him after the summer doing some data processing. The project resulted in publication.
